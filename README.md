# HuskyEats-Beta

Created to get comfortable with Firebase + Xcode. 

## Getting Started
1. Install CocoaPods, if you don't already have them.

```
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```
Detailed installation instructions[Here](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started)
(but the above should be fine.)

### This repo

Clone the repo @
```
$ git clone git@github.com:seansylee/HuskyEats-Beta.git
```
**note** : Be sure to open the `.xcworkspace` file *NOT* the `.xcodeproj` file as it will not contain the 
necessary pod files.
